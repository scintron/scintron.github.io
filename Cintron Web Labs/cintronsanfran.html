            San Fracisco: The Best and the Worst
        </h1>
        
        <h2>
            The best neighborhood is the Mission
        </h2>
       
        <p>
            I live in the <strong>Mission</strong>, I love the <strong>Mission</strong> with all its loud smells and vibrant colors.

        <h2>
            My least favorite neighborhood is the Marina.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            It's cold, wet, full of tourists and I can never seem to <em>get a moment's peace</em>.
